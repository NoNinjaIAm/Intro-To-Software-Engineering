# Welcome to Fruhb!
  Fruhb is an e-commerce web application for exotic fruits. It is a new, self-contained product that should be able to run on any modern web browser, which means there are no hardware requirements and limited software requirements. However, Fruhb will be run on a local host server. Being put into production was beyond the scope of the project. For example, there isn't an interface for sellers or admins.
